## Project management
- Version control/develop platform:

    Our group mainly uses GitHub and Gitee as the version control/develop platform, aiming to facilitate remote collaboration between team members.
    GitHub's commit feature allows team members to upload their code to the cloud repository. Then GitHub Actions will check code rationality after we push code. We use GitHub Issue to list the tasks that need to be completed during each iteration and limit the completion time through milestone. And we use different branches to manage project versions and publish them in GitHub Releases. Group membersâ€™ contributions are all documented in GitHub Insights.
    In order to facilitate team members with limited network access to connect the cloud repository, we configured GitHub repository mirror on Gitee platform.

- Journal tools:

    All code updates are recorded in the GitHub log. If there is a problem with the code, the person in charge can be found through the log.
    The QMPlus Hub keeps track of our application development timelines, team meetings, and personal progress.

- Communication tools:

    We use QMPlus Hub Forum to share and exchange views, Tencent Meeting for online meetings, and WeChat for private communication and group message notification. GitHub updates are also emailed to group members.

- Scheduling:

- Planning:

    At the beginning of each iteration, we planned iteration goals, formulated and distributed phase tasks through online meetings. We use milestone to set the completion time for each task to ensure the progress of the project.
    At the end of each iteration, the programmers are given a short vacation so that we can rest and be more productive.
