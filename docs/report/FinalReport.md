## Requirements

*• Apply the requirements finding techniques.
• User stories, including estimation and prioritise of user stories.
• Iterations planning.
• Prototype.
• Adapt to changes.*

## Analysis and Design

*• A set of design class diagrams describing the design of the software, show
the class relationships. Note that your design should address the issue of
reusability of software components. You should provide clear justification
for your proposed approach and show that your design is adaptable to
change where necessary.
• Discuss the design of the software.
• Discuss the extent to which your design and the code that implements it
meets the main design principles of programming.*

## Implementation and Testing

*• Discuss the implementation strategy and iteration/built plan.
• Discuss the test strategy and test techniques you have used in your
testing.

• Discuss the using of TDD. Note: TDD is not required for developing the
whole software, however, you should try to use TDD to develop a few
programs.*
